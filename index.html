        <div class="text1"> I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned <br> were current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I <br> honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.</div>
        <div class="text2">“ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”</div>

        <div class="text1">Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp <br> themselves. Getting guidance from them and learning from <br> their experiences was easy.“</div>
        <div class="text2">The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The program gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from an incredible community of smart and amazing people. ”</div>
